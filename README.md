### Hi there 👋

I'm 26 and I love my job: programming! 👨‍💻

I have several years of experience in the **Web** and **Mobile** Development field, both **frontend** and **backend** using a secure, state-of-the-art technology stack.

I always try do my best in all the projects I participate and lot of **teamwork**. 
I am determined to improve day by day in my job, which is also my main hobby, by **constantly learning** more and more about development methods and new libraries and technologies that I can use in the projects I'm involved.

I have a great spirit of initiative and I always try to take care of the product I work for as much as possible to **make the users** - always in the first place - **happy**.
